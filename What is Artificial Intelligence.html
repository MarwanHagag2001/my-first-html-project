Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines which are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal.
The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.

It has been demonstrated since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s that computers can be programmed to perform very complex tasks such as finding proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess with great skill. Nevertheless, despite continuing improvements in computer processing speed and memory power, no programs are yet available that can equal human versatility over broader domains or tasks requiring a great deal of everyday knowledge. On the other hand, certain algorithms have achieved the output standards of human experts and specialists in some particular tasks, So that artificial intelligence is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines and recognition of voice or handwriting in that limited sense.</p>
