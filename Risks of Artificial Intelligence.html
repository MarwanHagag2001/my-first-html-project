When thinking of how AI might become a risk, experts think two scenarios most likely:
<br>
<br>
1- The Artificial Intelligence is programmed to do something devastating: Autonomous weapons are systems of artificial intelligence programmed to kill. Those weapons could easily cause mass casualties in the hands of the wrong person. In addition, an AI arms race could unintentionally lead to an AI war, which would also result in mass casualties. These weapons would be designed to be extremely difficult to simply "turn off" to avoid being thwarted by the enemy, so humans could plausibly lose control of such a situation. This risk is one that even with narrow AI is present but is growing as AI intelligence and autonomy levels increase.

2- AI's amplified efficiency means malicious AI can attack a far greater number of devices and networks more quickly and cheaply than a malevolent human actor once a system is trained and deployed. An AI system can launch several attacks given sufficient computing power, be more selective in its targets and more destructive in its effects.</p>
